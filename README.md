## ðŸ“– About the Project

Developed as a project for the freeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with Python" course, this repository is a practical demonstration of **core data transformation techniques using Python**. While the output is a classic VigenÃ¨re cipher, the underlying process showcases the ability to process data entry by entry, apply complex rule-based logic, and handle data quality issuesâ€”all fundamental skills in Data Engineering.

The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages, serving as an excellent example of building invertible data transformation functions.

### âœ¨ Key Skills for Data Engineering

This project demonstrates foundational skills essential for building robust data pipelines:

- **Data Transformation Logic**: Implementation of a rule-based mapping algorithm, analogous to the 'T' in an ETL/ELT process.
- **Row-Level Processing**: Iterating through a dataset (a string, in this case) to apply transformations on a granular, character-by-character level.
- **Modular & Reusable Code**: Building clean, reusable functions (`encrypt`, `decrypt`) that can be components in a larger data workflow.
- **Data Cleaning & Validation**: Effectively handling non-conforming data (non-alphabetic characters) to ensure the pipeline's integrity and prevent failures.

### ðŸš€ How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Create and activate a virtual environment.
4.  Run the main script to see the example decryption:
    ```bash
    python3 src/main.py
    ```
